So I'm building this app for inspirational stuff. So a user can sign up and share what's Inspiring them. They can add a post and the post has an image, title, description, and a link to where they found their inspiration for their project. People can also like the post or dislike it as well as a comment. 

It's a working progress but this is how the design looks now (you can post anything anonymously with a caption that sparks inspiration) right now it still looks elementary but i like it so far haha.

if you want to join in on the development just message me. I'll happily add you as a collaborator (kinda need the help)
